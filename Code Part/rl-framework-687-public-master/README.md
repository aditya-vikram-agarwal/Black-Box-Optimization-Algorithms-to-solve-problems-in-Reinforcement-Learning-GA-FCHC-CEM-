# rl-framework-687-public
rl-framework-687-public is a reinforcement learning library for the Reinforcement Learning 687 course at UMass Amherst. The goal of this repository is to provide implementations of homework and other material from the fall 2019 RL course. 

## Installation

This repo does not require any deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. We only require numpy and Python 3. 

```
pip install numpy
```

Some files may use IPython, and an error will be thrown if this library is not properly installed. To install IPython, run:

```
pip install IPython
```

## Example

This example will run ```homework1.py``` located in the ```homeworks``` directory (we will update this example after the first submission). In the ```rl-framework-687-public``` directory, run:

```
python -m homeworks.homework1

```
